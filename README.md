## 📄Exercises Level 1 of Sprint1 Task 5

### Level1 Exercice1 :

  * Create a class that alphabetically lists the contents of a directory received as a parameter.

### Level1 Exercise 2

  * Extend the class from the previous exercise by adding functionality to list a directory tree
    with the content of all its levels recursively.
  * The output must be printed to the screen, arranged alphabetically within each level.
  * Additionally, it must indicate whether the item is a Directory (D) or a File (F), and show its last modification date.

### Level1 Exercise 3

  * Modify the previous exercise. Instead of displaying the result on the screen,
    save the entire output to a TXT file.

### Level1 Exercise 4

  * Add the functionality to read any TXT file and display its content on the console.

### Level1 Exercise 5

  * The program must now serialize a Java Object (convert it to a byte stream) into a .ser file and
    subsequently deserialize it (reconstruct the Java Object from the file).
